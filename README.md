[Discord.Net](https://github.com/RogueException/Discord.Net) hosting with [Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host). 
This package provides extensions to a .NET Generic Host (IHostBuilder) that will run a Discord.Net socket/sharded client as a controllable IHostedService. This simplifies initial bot creation and moves the usual boilerplate to a convenient builder pattern.

Discord.Net 2.2.0+ & .NET Core 2.1+ is required.

```csharp
var builder = new HostBuilder()               
  .ConfigureAppConfiguration(x =>
  {
    //..configuration
  })
  .ConfigureLogging(x =>
  {
    //..logging
  })
  .ConfigureDiscordHost<DiscordSocketClient>((context, config) =>
  {
     config.SocketConfig = new DiscordSocketConfig
      {
          LogLevel = LogSeverity.Verbose,
          AlwaysDownloadUsers = true,
          MessageCacheSize = 200
      };

    config.Token = context.Configuration["token"];
  })
  //Omit this if you don't use the command service
  .UseCommandService()
  .ConfigureServices((context, services) =>
  {
    //Add any other services here
    services.AddHostedService<CommandHandler>();
  })
  .UseConsoleLifetime();

var host = builder.Build();
using (host)
{
  await host.RunAsync();
}
```

### Basic Usage

1. Create a .NET Core application (or retrofit your existing one).
2. Add ```Discord.Addons.Hosting``` to your project.   
3. Create and start your application using a HostBuilder as shown above and in the examples linked below.

### Examples

Fully working examples are available [here](https://github.com/Hawxy/Discord.Addons.Hosting/tree/master/Samples)

If you want something more advanced, one of my bots CitizenEnforcer uses this extension. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Hawxy/CitizenEnforcer)

### Serilog

Serilog should be added to the host with ```Serilog.Extensions.Hosting```. 

See the Serilog [example](https://github.com/Hawxy/Discord.Addons.Hosting/tree/master/Samples/SampleBotSerilog) for usage.

### Service Initialization

This section assumes some prior knowledge of Dependency Injection within the .NET ecosystem. Take a read of [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection) and [this](https://discord.foxbot.me/stable/guides/commands/dependency-injection.html) if you have no idea what any of this means.

Most services people write within the Discord.NET world tend to fall in one of two buckets. One type gets instantiated & injected into `CommandModule`'s or other services by the container when required and simply exist to hold some basic state and/or abstract away common functionality. The other type is more complex and requires some kind of manual scaffolding to work as intended, such as subscribing to events published by the `DiscordSocketClient` or by performing an `async` request on creation. These services tend to operate in isolation and thus do not get initialized by being injected into a `CommandModule` or some other dependent service.

Since we're using a `Host`, this problem is easily solved, as the `IHostedService` can handle all of our initialization concerns for us. **Note: Implementations of `IHostedService` should generally not be injected into any other service/`CommandModule` etc, try to separate your initialization concerns from your functional concerns.**

- I've included the base class `InitializedService` for services that simply need to be initialized once for the lifetime of the application (such as a `CommandHandler`, and any isolated service that just listens to client events). This base class implements `IHostedService` and simply keeps track of if `InitializeAsync` has been called already. 

```csharp
public class CommandHandler : InitializedService
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _provider;
    private readonly DiscordSocketClient _client;
    private readonly CommandService _commandService;
    private readonly IConfiguration _config;

    public CommandHandler(IServiceProvider provider, DiscordSocketClient client, CommandService commandService, IConfiguration config)
    {
        _provider = provider;
        _client = client;
        _commandService = commandService;
        _config = config;
    }
    public override async Task InitializeAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        _client.MessageReceived += HandleMessage;
        _commandService.CommandExecuted += CommandExecutedAsync;
        await _commandService.AddModulesAsync(Assembly.GetEntryAssembly(), _provider);
    }
        
    //.....
}
 ````

- Services that run on a timer should either use the above pattern to start the timer, or an implementation of [BackgroundService](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/multi-container-microservice-net-applications/background-tasks-with-ihostedservice)

- Services with complex startup & shutdown activities should implement `IHostedService` directly.

### Shutdown

When shutdown is requested, the host will wait a maximum of 5 seconds for services to stop before timing out.

If you're finding that this isn't enough time, you can modify the shutdown timeout via the [ShutdownTimeout host setting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/host/generic-host?view=aspnetcore-3.0#shutdowntimeout).

### IOptions

This package uses `Microsoft.Extensions.Options` internally, so both the `DiscordHostConfiguration` and `CommandServiceConfig` can be configured within the services registration instead of within the `HostBuilder` extensions if it better suits your scenario.
